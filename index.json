This feature allows you to reserve and schedule Amazon EC2 accelerated GPU instances for future use, including NVIDIA Hopper GPU lines and AWS Trainium.\nAWS PCS is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run and scale HPC workloads and build scientific, engineering, or AI models on AWS using Slurm. With the addition of Capacity Blocks support, organizations can now ensure reserved access to accelerated computing resources when needed most, while still maintaining the simplicity of a fully managed service with operational responsibility for cluster management, updates, and monitoring.\nWhat are Capacity Blocks?\nCapacity Blocks is an EC2 feature that allows customers to reserve accelerated instances for future use by paying upfront. You can reserve blocks from 1 to 64 instances for a maximum duration of 6 months, with the ability to renew active reservations. This is particularly useful for organizations running large-scale training or inference workloads in AI or machine learning (ML), or GPU-accelerated code such as molecular dynamics or fluid dynamics, in HPC environments.\nKey Benefits\nReserved Access allows customers to reserve GPU instances up to 8 weeks in advance, ensuring resources are available for critical workloads while providing favorable pricing compared to on-demand rates. This feature fills the gap between flexible on-demand instances and long-term On-Demand Capacity Reservation (ODCR) commitments, making it ideal for customers running ML or HPC workloads that require consistent execution on powerful GPUs without long-term reservations. By allowing GPU resources to be reserved in advance, customers can maintain workflow continuity and optimize resource usage planning for scenarios such as periodic training cycles, scheduled model updates, and time-sensitive ML training jobs as well as research projects.\nFlexible Scheduling allows you to reserve GPU resources immediately for urgent tasks such as optimizing real-time inference, or schedule GPU jobs in advance on PCS for planned large-scale GPU workloads. With Slurm on PCS, you can queue jobs and they will start as soon as Capacity Block instances are ready. This flexibility ensures that you can access powerful instances when you need them, for example, to quickly fine-tune and validate models, or strategically schedule upcoming heavy workloads such as distributed training across multiple GPUs. Whether you are responding to immediate modeling needs or planning for large training pipelines, the ability to switch between immediate and future reservations ensures you always have access to the computing resources you need, while maintaining cost benefits and capacity reservations.\nCapacity Blocks also provides powerful resource sharing capabilities — allowing you to distribute reserved GPU instances across multiple PCS clusters. You can also combine multiple Capacity Blocks into a single large queue in PCS to maximize performance across different instance types. This helps maximize the value of reserved GPUs for diverse types of workloads or experiments. This capability also extends to sharing reserved capacity between multiple projects, ideal for organizations that want to efficiently allocate scheduled GPU resources between different initiatives or teams.\nSeamless Integration delivers a seamless experience by integrating Capacity Blocks directly into PCS Compute Node Groups (CNGs) through a simple purchase option. By simply updating the launch template, you can leverage all the familiar scheduling and queue management capabilities of PCS with reserved capacity. Groups can immediately use reserved GPU access while maintaining existing ML or HPC workflows and processes, making the switch to using Capacity Blocks as simple as selecting a new purchase option.\nGetting Started with Capacity Blocks in PCS\nBefore you get started, make sure you have created a PCS cluster (PCS cluster).\nCreate or Select a Capacity Block First, purchase your Capacity Block through the EC2 console, specifying:\nInstance type Number of instances (1-64) Duration (up to 6 months) Start date (up to 8 weeks in advance) Figure 1 – EC2 Capacity Blocks requirement dialog in AWS Management Console, showing instance type, capacity, duration, and start date.\nCreate Your Launch Template\nWe will create a launch template through the Amazon EC2 launch templates page.\nUpdate the instance type to match the instance type in your Capacity Block (in this case p5.4xlarge).\nFigure 2 – Create Launch Template dialog in AWS Management Console EC2, showing instance type matching the instance type specified when purchasing Capacity Block.\nIn Network settings, specify the Availability Zone corresponding to your Capacity Block (in this case us-west-2c) and select the security group you created during the PCS cluster setup process. You can leave other configurations as default or customize as preferred – they are not required to enable Capacity Blocks.\nFigure 3 – Create Launch Template dialog in AWS Management Console, showing Availability Zone matching Capacity Block\u0026rsquo;s AZ and security group matching PCS cluster\u0026rsquo;s security group. In Advanced Details, change the purchasing option to Capacity Blocks and under Capacity Reservation, select Specify Capacity Reservation. Choose your Reservation ID. Skip remaining details in Launch Template. This is the final step to enable Capacity Blocks.\nCreate Compute Node Group In the PCS Console, create a Compute Node Group by selecting your launch template and appropriate version. Update the instance profile if needed by creating a basic profile with permissions for EC2 instances to join AWS PCS cluster. Next, select the subnet corresponding to your Capacity Block and choose the Instance Type matching your Capacity Block, for example p5.4xlarge.\nFigure 5 – Create Compute Node Group dialog in AWS Management Console PCS, showing subnet matching Capacity Block\u0026rsquo;s subnet, instance type matching Capacity Block, and purchase option as \u0026ldquo;Capacity Block\u0026rdquo;. After a few minutes, you will see your instances running in the EC2 instances dashboard. When an instance passes the status check, it is ready to use.\nFigure 6 – EC2 Instances dashboard in AWS Management Console showing instance from Capacity Block launched by PCS and passed status check. Best Practices Tips\nWe recommend monitoring capacity utilization when sharing Capacity Blocks across multiple services using the console or CLI.\nTo change instance type or use a new Capacity Block, create a new compute node group instead of updating the existing one. This ensures smooth transition and avoids potential disruption to workloads.\nPlan job handling when Capacity Blocks expire: you can extend CB or alert groups through automatic EventBridge notifications. When extending CB, there is no disruption to jobs submitted to your PCS compute node group.\nTo identify expiring Capacity Blocks, note: EC2 will emit a Capacity Block Reservation Delivered event via EventBridge when a CB reservation starts, and a Capacity Block Reservation Expiration Warning 40 minutes before CB expires, with instances being reclaimed 30 minutes before CB expires. You can subscribe to these events and take appropriate action. More details are in the monitoring section of the official Capacity Blocks documentation.\nEnsure AZ (Availability Zone) matches between Capacity Block and compute node group (see Capacity Blocks launch guide).\nCapacity Blocks must be in scheduled or active status before connecting to PCS. If in scheduled status, PCS scheduler will keep jobs in queue until CB becomes active.\nWhen creating a compute node group, note that instances will not be launched until the start time of Capacity Reservation, even if the reservation was previously active.\nAvailability and Pricing\nPCS now supports Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks in all AWS Regions where both services are available.\nStandard pricing for PCS and Capacity Block applies. You will be charged for reserved capacity according to the EC2 Capacity Blocks pricing model, regardless of usage level.\nHappy Building!\nTAGS: AI, Compute, GPU, HPC, Machine Learning, Research Computing, Scientific Computing\n"},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/3-blogstranslated/3.2-blog2/","title":"Blog 2","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Announcing Amazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances By Sébastien Stormacq on September 12, 2025 in Amazon EC2 Mac Instances, Launch, News Permalink Comments\nPermalink Comments Share Voiced by Polly\nHaving used macOS since 2001 and Amazon EC2 Mac instances since they launched 4 years ago, I have helped many customers scale their continuous integration \u0026amp; deployment (CI/CD) pipelines on AWS. Today, I am thrilled to share that M4 and M4 Pro Mac Amazon EC2 instances are now officially available.\nDevelopment teams building applications for Apple platforms need powerful computing resources to handle complex build processes and run multiple iOS simulators simultaneously. As development projects grow increasingly larger and sophisticated, teams need higher performance and memory capacity to maintain fast development cycles.\nApple M4 Mac mini at the Core\nThe EC2 M4 Mac instances (called mac-m4.metal in the API) are built on the Apple M4 Mac mini and use the AWS Nitro System. They feature Apple silicon M4 chip with 10 CPU cores (four performance and six efficiency cores), 10-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine, and 24 GB unified memory, delivering improved performance for iOS and macOS application build workloads. When building and testing applications, M4 Mac instances deliver up to 20% better application build performance compared to EC2 M2 Mac instances.\nThe EC2 M4 Pro Mac instance (mac-m4pro.metal in the API) is equipped with Apple silicon M4 Pro chip with 14 CPU cores, 20 GPU cores, 16-core Neural Engine, and 48 GB unified memory. These instances provide up to 15% better application build performance compared to EC2 M2 Pro Mac instances. The increased memory capacity and compute power enable running multiple test iterations in parallel with multiple device simulators.\nEach M4 and M4 Pro Mac instance now comes with 2 TB of local storage, providing low-latency storage to improve caching and build \u0026amp; test performance.\nBoth instance types support macOS Sonoma version 15.6 and newer as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). The AWS Nitro system provides Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) network bandwidth up to 10 Gbps and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage bandwidth of 8 Gbps over high-speed Thunderbolt connections.\nEC2 Mac instances integrate seamlessly with AWS services, meaning you can:\nBuild automated CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline\nStore and manage multiple versions of your build secrets, such as Apple development certificates and keys, on AWS Secrets Manager\nManage your development infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation\nMonitor instance performance with Amazon CloudWatch\nHow to Get Started\nYou can launch an EC2 M4 or M4 Pro Mac instance through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs.\nIn the demo example, I will start an M4 Pro instance from the console. I first allocate a dedicated host to run my instances. On the AWS Management Console I go to EC2, then Dedicated Hosts, and select Allocate Dedicated Host.\nThen, I enter a Name tag and select the instance Family (mac‑m4pro) and instance type (mac‑m4pro.metal). I select an Availability Zone and uncheck Host maintenance.\nEC2 Mac M4 – Dedicated hosts\nOr I can use CLI:\naws ec2 allocate-hosts \u0026ndash;availability-zone-id \u0026ldquo;usw2-az4\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;auto-placement \u0026ldquo;off\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;host-recovery \u0026ldquo;off\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;host-maintenance \u0026ldquo;off\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;quantity 1 \u0026ndash;instance-type \u0026ldquo;mac-m4pro.metal\u0026rdquo;\nAfter the dedicated host is allocated to my account, I select the newly allocated host, then select the Actions menu and choose Launch instance(s) onto host.\nNote that the console provides you, among other information, the latest supported macOS versions for this host type. In this case, macOS 15.6.\nOn the Launch an instance page, I enter the Name. I select a macOS Sequoia AMI. I ensure the Architecture is Arm 64-bit and the instance type is mac-m4pro.metal.\nThe remaining parameters are not specific to EC2 Mac: network configuration and storage. When launching an instance for development, be sure to select a volume of at least 200 GB or more. The default 100 GB volume is not enough to download and install Xcode.\nWhen ready, I click the orange Launch instance button at the bottom of the page. The instance will quickly appear in the Running state in the console. However, it may take up to 15 minutes before you can connect via SSH.\nOr I can use this command:\naws ec2 run-instances \u0026ndash;image-id \u0026ldquo;ami-000420887c24e4ac8\u0026rdquo; \\ # AMI ID varies by region ! \u0026ndash;instance-type \u0026ldquo;mac-m4pro.metal\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;key-name \u0026ldquo;my-ssh-key-name\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;network-interfaces \u0026lsquo;{\u0026ldquo;AssociatePublicIpAddress\u0026rdquo;:true,\u0026ldquo;DeviceIndex\u0026rdquo;:0,\u0026ldquo;Groups\u0026rdquo;:[\u0026ldquo;sg-0c2f1a3e01b84f3a3\u0026rdquo;]}\u0026rsquo; \\ # Security Group ID depends on your config \u0026ndash;tag-specifications \u0026lsquo;{\u0026ldquo;ResourceType\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;instance\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;Tags\u0026rdquo;:[{\u0026ldquo;Key\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;Value\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;My Dev Server\u0026rdquo;}]}\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash;placement \u0026lsquo;{\u0026ldquo;HostId\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;h-0e984064522b4b60b\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;Tenancy\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;host\u0026rdquo;}\u0026rsquo; \\ # Host ID depends on your config\n\u0026ndash;private-dns-name-options \u0026lsquo;{\u0026ldquo;HostnameType\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;ip-name\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;EnableResourceNameDnsARecord\u0026rdquo;:true,\u0026ldquo;EnableResourceNameDnsAAAARecord\u0026rdquo;:false}\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash;count \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;\nInstalling Xcode from Terminal\nAfter the instance is accessible, I can connect via SSH and install development tools. I use xcodeinstall to download and install Xcode 16.4.\nFrom my laptop, I open a session with Apple developer credentials:\nI connect to the EC2 Mac instance I just launched. Then, I download and install Xcode:\nThings to Know\nSelect an EBS volume of at least 200 GB for development purposes. The default 100 GB volume is not enough to install Xcode. I typically choose 500 GB. When increasing EBS size after instance launch, remember to resize the APFS filesystem.\nAlternatively, you can choose to install your development tools and frameworks on the 2 TB low-latency internal SSD available in Mac mini. Note that the contents of this volume are attached to the instance lifecycle, not the dedicated host. This means everything will be deleted from the internal SSD when you stop and restart the instance.\nThe mac-m4.metal and mac-m4pro.metal instances support macOS Sequoia 15.6 and newer versions.\nYou can migrate existing EC2 Mac instances when the migration instance is running macOS 15 (Sequoia). Create a custom AMI from your existing instance and launch an M4 or M4 Pro instance from that AMI.\nFinally, I suggest you check the guides I wrote to help you get started with EC2 Mac:\nLaunch an EC2 Mac instance\nConnect to an EC2 Mac instance (I show you three different ways to connect)\nBuild your iOS applications faster with a CI/CD pipeline on EC2 Mac\nPricing and Availability\nEC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances are now available in US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon), with plans to expand to other regions in the future.\nEC2 Mac instances can be purchased as Dedicated Hosts under On-Demand pricing and Savings Plans. EC2 Mac billing is per second with a minimum of 24 hours allocation to comply with Apple\u0026rsquo;s macOS software license agreement. After the 24-hour minimum, the host can be released at any time without further commitment.\nAs someone working closely with Apple developers, I am curious to see how you will use these new instances to accelerate your development cycle. The combination of increased performance, improved memory capacity, and integration with AWS services opens up many possibilities for teams building applications for iOS, macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS. Beyond application development, the Neural Engine of Apple silicon makes these instances a cost-effective candidate for running machine learning (ML) inference workloads. I will discuss this topic in detail at AWS re:Invent 2025, where I will share benchmarks and best practices to optimize ML workloads on EC2 Mac.\nTo learn more about EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances, you can visit the Amazon EC2 Mac Instances page or consult the EC2 Mac documentation. You can start using these instances today to modernize your Apple development workflows on AWS.\nSébastien Stormacq\nSeb has been writing code since the Commodore 64 in the eighties.

The AWS IoT rules engine is a component of AWS IoT core that provides SQL-like capabilities to filter, transform, and decode your IoT device data. You can use AWS IoT rules to route over 20 AWS services and HTTP endpoints by using AWS IoT rule actions. Substitution templates are a capability in IoT rules that help enrich the JSON data returned when an IoT rule is triggered and AWS IoT performs an action. This blog post explores how AWS IoT rule actions with substitution templates unlock simpler, more powerful IoT architectures. You will learn proven ways to cut costs and increase scalability. Through real-world examples of message routing and load balancing, you will build smarter, more efficient IoT solutions.\nUnderstanding the Basic Components\nEach AWS IoT rule is built on three basic components: an SQL-like statement that handles message filtering and transformation, one or more AWS IoT rule actions that run and route data to other various AWS services and third-party services, and optional functions that can be used in both the SQL statement and rule actions.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of an AWS IoT rule and its components.\nThe SQL statement acts as the rule processing gateway and determines which MQTT messages will be processed based on specific topic patterns and conditions. This rule uses a SQL-like statement and supports SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses (for more information, see AWS IoT SQL reference). In this structure, the FROM clause defines the MQTT topic filter, while the SELECT and WHERE clauses specify which data elements will be extracted or transformed from incoming messages.\nFunctions are essential to both SQL statements and rule actions in IoT rules. AWS IoT rules provide a rich collection of built-in functions designed to transform data types, manipulate strings, perform mathematical operations, process timestamps, and much more. Additionally, AWS IoT rules also provide external functions that help you retrieve data from AWS services (such as Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, Amazon Secrets Manager, and AWS IoT Device Shadow) and embed that data in your message payload. These functions support complex data transformations directly within the rule processing pipeline and eliminate the need for external processing.\nRule actions determine the destination and how processed data is handled. AWS IoT rules support a library of built-in rule actions that can transmit data to AWS services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). These rule actions can also transmit data to third-party services like Apache Kafka. Each rule action can be configured with specific parameters that govern how data is delivered or processed by the destination service.\nSubstitution Templates: The Hidden Gem\nYou can implement functions in the SELECT and WHERE clauses of AWS IoT rules to transform and prepare message data. However, if you apply this approach too frequently, you might miss the powerful option of using substitution templates and performing transformations directly in the action of your IoT rule.\nSubstitution templates support dynamic insertion of rule values and functions into rule action JSON using the ${expression} syntax. These templates support many of the same functions as SQL statements, such as timestamp manipulation, encoding/decoding operations, string processing, and topic extraction. By using substitution templates in AWS IoT rule actions, you can implement sophisticated routing that significantly reduces complexity in other layers of your architecture, delivering simpler, more powerful AWS IoT solutions.\nReal-World Implementation Patterns\nLet\u0026rsquo;s explore some real-world examples that demonstrate the flexibility and power of using substitution templates in AWS IoT rule actions. These examples will illustrate how this feature can simplify IoT data processing workflows and unlock new possibilities for your IoT applications.\nExample 1: Conditional Message Distribution Using AWS IoT Registry Attributes\nConsider a common IoT scenario where a message distribution platform delivers device messages to different business partners, and each partner has their own SQS message processing queue. Different partners own each device in the fleet, and their relationship is maintained in the registry as an attribute called partnerId.\nThe traditional approach involves the following:\nOption 1 – Maintain partner routing logic on the device. Multiple AWS IoT rules based on WHERE conditions to input payload:\nRequires the device to know the partner\u0026rsquo;s ID. Increases device complexity and maintenance. Creates security concerns when exposing partner identifiers. Makes managing partner changes difficult. Option 2 – Use an intermediate Lambda function to retrieve the partner ID value associated with the device from the AWS IoT registry and then deliver the message to the partner\u0026rsquo;s specific SQS queue:\nAdds unnecessary compute and registry query costs. May increase message latency. Creates additional points of failure. Requires maintaining routing logic. May encounter Lambda concurrency limits. Here is a more sophisticated solution and process using substitution templates and the new AWS IoT attribute propagation feature:\nInsert Partner ID as an attribute in the AWS IoT registry.\nUse the attribute propagation feature to enrich your MQTTv5 user properties and dynamically build Amazon SQS queue URLs using the device\u0026rsquo;s partnerId. See the example below: Using this solution, a device with partnerId=\u0026ldquo;partner123″ will publish a message. This message will automatically be routed to the SQS queue \u0026ldquo;partner-queue-partner123\u0026rdquo;.\nBenefits of this solution:\nThe use of substitution templates significantly simplifies architecture and provides a scalable and maintainable solution for partner-specific message distribution. This solution,\nEliminates the need for additional compute resources. Provides instant routing without increasing latency. Simplifies managing partner relationships through updates in the AWS IoT registry. For example, introducing a new partner can be updated by modifying registry attributes. This update does not require any updates or changes to the device or routing logic. Maintains security by not exposing queue information to devices. Example 2: Intelligent Load Balancing with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose\nConsider a scenario where millions of devices publish telemetry measurement data to the same topic. It is also necessary to distribute this large volume of data across multiple Amazon Data Firehose streams to avoid congestion issues when buffering data into Amazon S3.\nThe traditional approach includes:\nDevice-side load balancing:\nDeploy configuration management to provide different stream IDs across devices. Require devices to include the target stream in their messages. Create multiple AWS IoT rules to match specific stream IDs. AWS Lambda-based routing:\nDeploy a Lambda function to distribute messages across streams. Implement custom load balancing logic. Traditional approaches also create similar negative impacts as mentioned in the previous example (maintenance costs, security vulnerabilities, device complexity, additional costs, increased latency, and points of failure). Moreover, they pose specific challenges in large workload scenarios, such as the risk of high bandwidth throttling and complex stream management.\nBy leveraging AWS IoT rule substitution templates, you can implement a serverless, streamlined load balancing solution that dynamically assigns messages to different Firehose distribution streams by:\nCreating a random number from 0-100000 using rand()*100000. Converting (casting) this random number to an integer. Using the modulo (mod) operation to get the remainder when dividing by 8. Adding this remainder (0-7) to the \u0026ldquo;firehose_stream_\u0026rdquo; base name. The result is that messages are randomly distributed across eight different Amazon Data Firehose streams (firehose_stream_0 through firehose_stream_7). See the example below:\n{ \u0026#34;ruleArn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:rule/testFirehoseBalancing\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rule\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ruleName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;testFirehoseBalancing\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sql\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SELECT * FROM \u0026#39;devices/+/telemetry\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;createdAt\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-04-11T11:09:02+00:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;firehose\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;roleArn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/firebaseDistributionRoleDemo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deliveryStreamName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firehose_stream_${mod(cast((rand()*100000) as Int),8)}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;separator\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;batchMode\u0026#34;: false } } ], \u0026#34;ruleDisabled\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;awsIotSqlVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2016-03-23\u0026#34; } } Benefits of this solution:\nThis flexible load balancing model helps process large volumes of messages by distributing the load across multiple streams. The key advantage of this approach lies in its scalability. By modifying the modulo function (which determines the remainder of division, for example: 5 mod 3 = 2), the divisor (currently set to 8) can be adjusted to match the desired number of streams. For example:\nChange to mod(…, 4) to distribute across 4 streams. Change to mod(…, 16) to distribute across 16 streams. Using this pattern makes it easy to scale your architecture up or down without changing the core logic of the rule.\nExample 3: Using CASE Statements in Substitution Templates to Build Conditional Routing Logic\nConsider a situation where you need to route your IoT device data, depending on the specific device, to either a production Lambda function or a development/testing (Dev/Test) Lambda function.\nThe traditional approach includes the following:\nDevice-side load balancing:\nDeploy configuration management to provide different environment IDs across devices. Require devices to include the environment ID in their messages. Create multiple AWS IoT rules to match specific environment IDs. AWS Lambda-based routing:\nDeploy a Lambda function to distribute messages to different AWS Lambda functions across environments after checking with the AWS IoT registry (or alternative database). Traditional approaches also have similar negative impacts as mentioned in previous examples.\nHere is a more sophisticated solution and process using substitution templates and the new AWS IoT attribute propagation feature:\nAssociate environment ID as an attribute to all devices in AWS IoT Registry Use the attribute propagation feature to enrich your MQTTv5 user properties Use propagated attributes to dynamically build the AWS Lambda function ARN in a CASE statement embedded in the AWS IoT Rule action definition. See the example below:\n{ \u0026#34;ruleArn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:123456789012:rule/ConditionalActions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rule\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ruleName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;testLambdaConditions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sql\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SELECT * FROM \u0026#39;devices/+/telemetry\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;createdAt\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-04-11T11:09:02+00:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;lambda\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;functionArn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:${CASE get(get_user_properties(\u0026#39;environment\u0026#39;),0) WHEN \\\u0026#34;PROD\\\u0026#34; THEN \\\u0026#34;message_handler_PROD\\\u0026#34; WHEN \\\u0026#34;DEV\\\u0026#34; THEN \\\u0026#34;message_handler_DEV\\\u0026#34; WHEN NULL THEN \\\u0026#34;message_handler_PROD\\\u0026#34; ELSE \\\u0026#34;message_handler_PROD\\\u0026#34; END }\u0026#34;, } } ], \u0026#34;ruleDisabled\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;awsIotSqlVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2016-03-23\u0026#34; } } Benefits of this solution:\nThe use of substitution templates significantly simplifies architecture and provides a scalable and maintainable solution for partner-specific message distribution. This solution,\nEliminates the need to define separate IoT rules and rule actions for each condition. Helps you reduce the cost of using IoT rules and rule actions. Conclusion:\nThis blog post has explored how substitution templates for AWS IoT rules can transform complex IoT architectures into sophisticated and efficient solutions. The examples have demonstrated that substitution templates are not just a feature – they are a powerful architectural tool that leverages the capabilities of AWS IoT to effectively solve complex challenges without adding complexity or cost. Substitution templates provide a serverless, scalable approach that eliminates the need for additional computing resources or complex client-side logic. This approach not only reduces operational costs but also delivers immediate cost benefits by eliminating unnecessary computing resources and simplifying the overall architecture.\nThe next time you find yourself designing AWS IoT message routing patterns or facing scalability challenges, consider how substitution templates can provide a simpler and more efficient solution.

Introduce Amazon Bedrock service in detail along with supported Foundation Models. Present the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technical process to build smarter, more accurate AI applications and reduce hallucination phenomena. Overview the ecosystem of specialized AI services on AWS and how they integrate with Bedrock. Speakers List Lam Tuan Kiet - Sr DevOps Engineer, FPT Software. Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi - AI Engineer, Renova Cloud. Dinh Le Hoang Anh - Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey. Event Highlights Transition: From Traditional ML to Foundation Models Traditional Machine Learning models operate in a \u0026ldquo;one model – one task\u0026rdquo; fashion, requiring large amounts of labeled data and complex training and deployment processes.\nFoundation Models (FM) are trained on massive amounts of unlabeled data, providing better generalization and applicability to various tasks such as text generation, summarization, question-answering, and chatbots.\nAWS AI Ecosystem Amazon Bedrock is a hub for advanced models from AI21, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon\u0026rsquo;s own models.\nBeyond FMs, AWS provides a series of Specialized AI Services – ready-to-use services without needing self-training:\nAmazon Rekognition: Image and video recognition and analysis. Amazon Translate: Real-time language translation. Amazon Textract: Extract structured data from scanned documents. Amazon Transcribe: Convert audio to text. Amazon Polly: Convert text to speech. Amazon Comprehend: Sentiment analysis, topic detection, keyword extraction. Amazon Kendra: Natural language search within enterprise documents. Amazon Lookout: Detect anomalies in industrial systems. Amazon Personalize: Build real-time recommendation systems. Prompting Technique: Chain of Thought (CoT) Comparison between Standard Prompting (asking and getting a direct answer) and Chain-of-Thought Prompting. CoT encourages the model to think out loud, breaking down problems into multiple reasoning steps. This approach is particularly effective for complex logical problems and often yields more accurate and consistent results compared to direct question answering. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) The Problem: LLMs are often limited by their training data (not continuously updated) and sometimes produce hallucinations. The Solution: Combine LLMs with an external Knowledge Base retrieval layer. The model retrieves relevant information and uses it to construct answers – rather than relying solely on memorized knowledge. Data Ingestion Process: Collect new data and divide it into chunks. Pass each chunk through an Embeddings model (e.g., Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2.0) to convert to vectors. Store these vectors in a Vector Store (OpenSearch Serverless, Pinecone, Redis, etc.). RetrieveAndGenerate API: Handles the entire pipeline: receives user input → creates embedding for the query → queries Vector Store → injects context into prompt → calls LLM to generate final answer. Learning Outcomes About AI and Cloud Better understand when to use specialized AI services – suitable for quick and specific tasks – versus when to use Generative AI or Bedrock for creative problems or high customization needs. Understand RAG thinking, which focuses more on data organization and providing proper context rather than just calling an LLM API. Technical Architecture Better understand how an AI system works end-to-end. Not just \u0026ldquo;call the model to generate an answer,\u0026rdquo; but the system requires many data preparation and information organization steps before AI can answer accurately.\nRAG architecture is broken down into clear steps: data collection → chunking → storage in search repository → retrieval of relevant information → feeding into the model for answering. This step-by-step approach makes management and scaling easier as data grows.\nApplication to Work Standardize unstructured data: Use Textract and Bedrock Agents to automate extraction of information from forms, invoices, and scanned documents, minimizing manual work.\nSupport decision-making: Apply generative models to automatically summarize reports, highlight key metrics, and suggest actions based on current data.\nEvent Experience Attending the workshop was very valuable, providing me a comprehensive view of AI and how to use it optimally and reasonably. The game section was also very helpful in reinforcing the knowledge learned during the workshop.\nNetworking and Exchange The workshop created opportunities for direct discussions with speakers, helping me understand more about AI usage and some new AI tools. After each presentation, I had access to the speakers\u0026rsquo; LinkedIn profiles to continue learning afterward. Key Takeaways Attending the workshop gave me a clearer perspective on how to apply AI effectively. I realized that RAG is an important component for AI to provide accurate answers based on enterprise-internal data.\nAdditionally, I was impressed by AWS\u0026rsquo;s comprehensive ecosystem — from storage, models, to orchestration tools — making building a real AI application much easier and more feasible.\n"},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/5-workshop/5.1-workshop-overview/","title":"Introduction","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Goals Introduce the serverless workshop: create Lambda (Node.js/Python), accept input parameters, integrate API Gateway, and deploy an in-app purchase suggestion API.

"},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/2-proposal/","title":"Proposal","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Online Library - Serverless Content Platform For Small Groups 1. Executive Summary The Online Library project aims to build a serverless, low-cost platform for storing and distributing content (PDF/ePub) to a small group of users (initially ~100 people, a group comprising students/lab members who need to share moderated internal research documents). This solution prioritizes security, content approval workflow (Admin Approval), and transparent, linear operational costs as it scales. The architecture uses completely AWS Serverless (Amplify, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, S3, CloudFront, DynamoDB). Estimated MVP cost (not counting Free Tier) ≈ $9.80/month, ensuring scalability to 5,000 to 50,000 users with predictable costs.\n2. Problem What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem? Documents and books are scattered; lack of a secure content delivery system with access control; adding or content approval processes are time-consuming and involve various legal issues.\nSolution Build a serverless pipeline on AWS: Users upload via Presigned PUT URL (to temporary S3); Admin approves → Lambda moves file to public folder (but protected); Readers access via Signed GET URL (from CloudFront/CDN) to ensure speed and access control.\nBenefits and Return on Investment Business Value: Centralize content; quality control through approval workflow; rapid deployment with CI/CD. Technical Benefits: Low operational cost (≈ $9.80/month at MVP, not counting Free Tier); Serverless architecture can easily scale large ; secure content access. 3. Solution Architecture A. High-level B. Request Processing Flow AWS Services Used Service Primary Role Specific Operations Amplify Hosting CI/CD + FE Hosting Build \u0026amp; Deploy Next.js, manage domain Cognito Authentication Sign up/Login, issue JWT, refresh token API Gateway API Entry Point Receive request, authenticate JWT, route to Lambda Lambda Business Logic Handle upload, approval, create signed URL, write metadata S3 Object Storage Store original file, approved file, downloaded via Cloudfront Signed URL CloudFront CDN Fast content distribution, block direct access via OAC DynamoDB Database Store metadata (book name, uploader, approval status) Route 53 DNS Point domain to Amplify Hosting, API Gateway, CloudFront CloudWatch Monitoring Store Lambda logs, alert on errors or unusual costs Search:\nSimple search by field (ex: book name, author), use DynamoDB GSIs for these attributes and query by GSI. Request Processing Flow User Upload: Presigned PUT to S3 uploads/ folder. Admin Approval: Lambda copies file from uploads/ to public/books/ when approved. Reader Security: CloudFront uses Origin Access Control (OAC) to block direct S3 access and only allow reading via Signed URL (short-lived) created by Lambda. Search Architecture Simple Search: Design GSI for title and author (example: GSI1: PK=TITLE#{normalizedTitle}, SK=BOOK#{bookId}; GSI2: PK=AUTHOR#{normalizedAuthor}, SK=BOOK#{bookId}). Add GET /search?title=...\u0026amp;author=... endpoint to query by GSI instead of Scan. Admin Permissions Use Cognito User Groups with an Admins group in User Pool. When Admin logs in, JWT contains cognito:groups: [\u0026quot;Admins\u0026quot;]. Admin business Lambda functions (e.g., approveBook, takedownBook) must check this claim; if missing group, return 403 Forbidden. Can use JWT Authorizer (API Gateway HTTP API) for authentication, with detailed authorization handled in Lambda based on claims. 4. Technical Implementation Deployment Design \u0026amp; IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code): Build CDK stacks (Cognito, DDB, S3, Amplify, Lambda, API). Upload \u0026amp; Approval Flow: Implement Presigned PUT, save metadata (status: pending), and Admin approval logic (copy file). Book Reading Flow: Implement Signed GET endpoint, and reading interface (FE stream via CloudFront). Operations: Setup CloudWatch logs (short retention), Budget Alerts, IAM hardening. Search: MVP: add GSI for title, author and GET /search endpoint query by GSI. Technical Requirements Use CDK to define entire infrastructure. API Gateway must be HTTP API for cost optimization. Lambda (Python) handles business logic and DynamoDB/S3 interactions. S3 Bucket Policy must block public access and only allow CloudFront OAC. 5. Timeline and Milestones Project Timeline Foundation \u0026amp; Authentication (Weeks 1-2) Goal: set up infrastructure and enable user login.\nBackend Tasks (CDK/DevOps): Write CDK stack for Cognito (User Pool, App Client). Write CDK stack for DynamoDB (main table, no GSI yet). Write CDK stack for S3 (Buckets uploads, public, logs) and configure OAC (Origin Access Control). Deploy API Gateway (HTTP API) and a \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; Lambda to test. Frontend Tasks (Amplify): Configure Amplify Hosting and connect to GitHub repo (CI/CD). Integrate Amplify UI / Cognito SDK for pages: Sign Up, Email Verification, Login, Forgot Password. Milestone: Developer can git push and FE auto-deploys. Users can sign up/login and receive JWT token. Upload \u0026amp; Approval Flow (Weeks 2-3) Goal: enable signed-in users to upload files and Admin to approve them.\nBackend Tasks (CDK/Lambda): Write Lambda createUploadUrl: Authenticate JWT (must be logged in). Create Presigned PUT URL pointing to S3 uploads/ folder. Write metadata to DynamoDB (status: PENDING). Write Lambda approveBook: Authenticate JWT (must be Admin). Copy file from uploads/ to public/books/. Update status in DynamoDB (status: APPROVED). Frontend Tasks: Build Upload Form (drag-drop, file selection). Call API createUploadUrl to get URL. Perform file upload (HTTP PUT) directly to S3 Presigned URL. Build Admin Interface: Get list of books with status PENDING. Have \u0026ldquo;Approve\u0026rdquo; button (calls API approveBook). Reading \u0026amp; Search Flow (Weeks 3-4) Goal: enable users to read and search approved books.\nBackend Tasks (CDK/Lambda): Write Lambda getReadUrl: Authenticate JWT (must be logged in). Check book has status APPROVED. Create Signed GET URL (short-lived) via CloudFront pointing to file in public/books/. Update CDK: Add GSI (Global Secondary Index) for title and author to DynamoDB table. Write Lambda searchBooks: Query DynamoDB by GSI (no Scan). Frontend Tasks: Build Home Page: Display book list (from API, no URLs). Build Search Bar (call API searchBooks). Build Reading Interface (Reader): When clicking \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo;, call API getReadUrl. Use received URL to render file (e.g., use react-pdf). Operations \u0026amp; Security (Weeks 5-6) Goal: harden the system, make it safe and easy to monitor.\nBackend Tasks (CDK/Lambda): Setup S3 Event Notification (for uploads/). Write Lambda validateMimeType: Trigger on new file, read \u0026ldquo;magic bytes\u0026rdquo; to validate PDF/ePub. If wrong, update status: REJECTED_INVALID_TYPE. Write Lambda takedownBook (API for Admin) and deleteUpload (delete PENDING files after 72h). DevOps Tasks (AWS Console/CDK): Setup AWS Budget Alerts (alert when cost exceeds $X). Setup CloudWatch Alarms (e.g.: Lambda error rate \u0026gt; 5%). Review IAM (ensure \u0026ldquo;least-privilege\u0026rdquo;), CORS (only allow Amplify domain). 6. Budget Estimation You can find the budget estimation on the: AWS Pricing Calculator\nBelow is a strict monthly cost estimate (assuming no AWS Free Tier applied) at MVP scale (100 users).\n# AWS Service Region Monthly (USD) Notes 0 Amazon CloudFront Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.86 10 GB data egress + 10,000 HTTPS requests 1 AWS Amplify Asia Pacific (Singapore) 1.31 100 build min + 0.5 GB storage + 2 GB served 2 Amazon API Gateway Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.01 ~10,000 HTTP API calls/month 3 AWS Lambda Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.00 128 MB RAM × 100 ms × 10,000 invokes 4 Amazon S3 (Standard) Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.05 2 GB object storage for books/images 5 Data Transfer Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.00 Included in CloudFront cost 6 DynamoDB (On-Demand) Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.03 Light metadata table (0.1 GB, few reads/writes) 7 Amazon Cognito Asia Pacific (Singapore) 5.00 100 MAU, Advanced Security enabled 8 Amazon CloudWatch Asia Pacific (Singapore) 1.64 5 metrics + 0.1 GB logs/month 9 Amazon Route 53 Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.90 1 Hosted Zone + DNS queries ≈ 9.80 USD / month No Free Tier applied Infrastructure Cost This cost model demonstrates serverless architecture efficiency: costs focus mainly on value delivered to users (Cognito MAU) rather than paying for \u0026ldquo;idle servers\u0026rdquo;.\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Risk Impact Mitigation Strategy Cost increases with user surge High Limit MAU, cache metadata via CloudFront Upload abuse Medium Limit ≤ 50MB/file, auto-delete after 72h Fake/malicious files Medium S3 Event → Lambda validate MIME (magic bytes) Monitoring overload Low CloudWatch alert, 14-day log retention Mitigation Strategies Costs: Set AWS Budget Alerts for CloudFront and Cognito. Understand Signed URL has short TTL so no long-term public cache; instead, cache metadata/API response (book list, details) on CloudFront 3–5 min to reduce API load. Only create Signed URL when user actually clicks read (on‑demand), not pre-create for entire list. Uploads: Limit file size ≤ 50MB for MVP. (Can increase to 200MB later, use multipart upload in FE to avoid timeout.) Apply Rate Limit/Throttling on API Gateway for Presigned URL creation endpoints. Set S3 Lifecycle Policy to auto-delete unapproved files in uploads/ after 72h. Add Server‑side Validation: S3 Event Notifications → Lambda read magic bytes (e.g., file-type library) to validate PDF/ePub; if invalid, auto-delete and set status REJECTED_INVALID_TYPE in DynamoDB. Copyright (DMCA): Store Audit Log in DynamoDB: uploaderID, uploadTimestamp, adminApproverID, approvalTimestamp for traceability. Build Takedown API (Admin only): update status TAKEDOWN; optionally move object from public/books/ to quarantine/books/ (don\u0026rsquo;t delete) to keep records. Contingency Plan If costs exceed budget, can temporarily limit new users via invite system to control Cognito MAU and optimize file size.\n8. Expected Results Technical Improvements: Ensure fast content delivery speed and security (CDN + Signed URL). Create a standard Serverless architecture on AWS, easily scalable to 50,000 users without core architecture changes. Fully automated CI/CD for both Frontend and Backend (CDK/Amplify). Long-term Value Establish a centralized, structured data platform for book content. Provide a living reference documentation for E2E Serverless implementation. Potential to integrate analytics services (like Amazon QuickSight) or AI/ML in the future. This system demonstrates the ability to build secure, cost-efficient, and easily scalable content platforms using AWS Serverless — suitable for real-world deployment in small groups.\n9.

You will learn what Capacity Blocks are, why they are useful for model training, inference, and scientific simulation tasks, and how PCS leverages this feature to provide a flexible, scalable, and reliable computing environment. The article also guides you through the process of setting up Capacity Blocks in PCS — from purchasing blocks, creating launch templates, configuring compute node groups — to best practices for operations, as well as pricing information, supported regions, and monitoring events to ensure seamless operations.\nBlog 2 - Announcing Amazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances This blog introduces the Amazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances — a new generation for Apple application development teams requiring high build \u0026amp; test performance. You will learn how Apple silicon M4/M4 Pro delivers improved build speeds (up to 20% faster than M2 Mac), larger unified memory, and 2 TB of local storage to accelerate caching. The article also guides you through allocating dedicated hosts, choosing appropriate macOS AMIs, configuring storage, and installing Xcode in the EC2 environment. Additionally, the blog shares important considerations for operating EC2 Mac, CI/CD integration options with AWS, and pricing \u0026amp; region availability information, helping Apple development teams modernize their workflows on AWS in a flexible and efficient manner.\nBlog 3 - Harnessing the Power of AWS IoT Rules with Substitution Templates This blog introduces how to leverage substitution templates in AWS IoT Rules to optimize IoT architecture. You will learn how AWS IoT Core and the rules engine use SQL-like syntax to filter, transform, and route data to over 20 AWS services. The article explains why substitution templates are the \u0026ldquo;secret weapon\u0026rdquo; that simplifies architecture, reduces Lambda dependencies, cuts costs, and increases scalability. The blog also illustrates 3 real-world scenarios: routing messages by partnerId from IoT Registry, intelligent load balancing across multiple Firehose streams using rand() + mod functions, and dynamic routing to different Lambda functions using CASE statements. Through these examples, you will see how to build flexible, serverless IoT solutions that are easier to maintain thanks to the ability to dynamically insert values directly in AWS IoT Rule actions.\n"},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/5-workshop/5.3-lambda-basics/","title":"Lambda Basics","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Objectives Create and test a Lambda Hello World (Node.js/Python), pass input parameters, and fine-tune configurations (memory, timeout, log).\nKey Steps Create a Node.js function\nRuntime: Node.js 18.x (example).

Work Environment\nThe atmosphere at FCJ is very comfortable and friendly. Everyone is approachable and always ready to help, even with questions after work hours when I face difficulties. The spacious, neat, and clean work space helps me concentrate better. The company frequently organizes interesting and beneficial events that help me learn new knowledge from those who came before.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nMy mentor guided me very dedicatedly, explaining clearly every part I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand and always encouraging me to ask questions freely. Especially at the beginning when I faced difficulties creating an AWS account, the team members helped me very enthusiastically, and during the final project, everyone supported my team tremendously.\n3. Alignment between Work and Academic Major\nAlthough I studied Artificial Intelligence at school, when I interned at FCJ, I was exposed to the Cloud field — a field quite different from what I had previously learned. However, this actually helped me broaden my perspective and learn a lot of completely new knowledge that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t had the opportunity to explore before. As a result, I not only supplemented practical skills but also gained a better understanding of how the systems behind the AI applications I studied in class actually work.\n4. Learning Opportunities \u0026amp; Skill Development\nDuring my internship, I learned many things: how to use project management tools, how to collaborate in a team, and how to communicate more professionally in a corporate environment. My mentor also shared many real-world experiences, helping me better understand what working in a corporate environment is like.\n5. Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nI really like the culture here. Everyone respects each other, works seriously but maintains enjoyment. When teammates face account or project issues, everyone helps each other to the fullest, regardless of position or role. This made me feel that I\u0026rsquo;m not alone in the corporate environment.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company and school have created a good internship environment and flexible working hours when I have personal matters. Additionally, being able to participate in company-organized events helped me learn many valuable things — this is a big plus for me.\nAdditional Questions What are you most satisfied with during your internship? -\u0026gt; What I\u0026rsquo;m most satisfied with during my internship is the spirit of FCJ team members. Everyone has such wonderful positive energy that made me feel comfortable even though it was our first meeting, making my internship experience very great. Especially those fruits that brother Kha bought for us every afternoon.\nWhat do you think the company needs to improve for future interns? -\u0026gt; After 3 months of internship based on my personal perception, the company has nothing that needs improvement for future interns.\nIf you recommend to your friends, would you recommend them to intern here? Why? -\u0026gt; If I have friends, I will recommend everyone to intern here. Because I think beyond the excellent internship environment, knowledge is also a very important part, and this is knowledge that is quite necessary for people like us who study information technology, and I think everyone should try to get in touch with it to see if they\u0026rsquo;re suited for this field, you never know if it might be the door that opens a path to a new horizon for everyone.\n"},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
