#### Resource Cleanup

Congratulations on completing this lab!
In this lab, you learned about architectural patterns to access Amazon S3 without using the Public Internet.

+ By creating a Gateway endpoint, you enabled direct communication between EC2 resources and Amazon S3, bypassing the Internet Gateway.
By creating an Interface endpoint, you extended S3 connectivity to resources running in your on-premises data center through AWS Site-to-Site VPN or Direct Connect.

#### Cleanup Steps
