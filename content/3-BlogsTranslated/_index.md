This section lists and introduces the blog posts that have been translated.

###  [Blog 1 - Announcing Capacity Blocks Support for AWS Parallel Computing Service](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog introduces the support for Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks in AWS Parallel Computing Service (PCS), enabling users to reserve and schedule GPU instances for AI/ML and HPC workloads. You will learn what Capacity Blocks are, why they are useful for model training, inference, and scientific simulation tasks, and how PCS leverages this feature to provide a flexible, scalable, and reliable computing environment. The article also guides you through the process of setting up Capacity Blocks in PCS — from purchasing blocks, creating launch templates, configuring compute node groups — to best practices for operations, as well as pricing information, supported regions, and monitoring events to ensure seamless operations.

###  [Blog 2 - Announcing Amazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog introduces the Amazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances — a new generation for Apple application development teams requiring high build & test performance. You will learn how Apple silicon M4/M4 Pro delivers improved build speeds (up to 20% faster than M2 Mac), larger unified memory, and 2 TB of local storage to accelerate caching. The article also guides you through allocating dedicated hosts, choosing appropriate macOS AMIs, configuring storage, and installing Xcode in the EC2 environment. Additionally, the blog shares important considerations for operating EC2 Mac, CI/CD integration options with AWS, and pricing & region availability information, helping Apple development teams modernize their workflows on AWS in a flexible and efficient manner.

###  [Blog 3 - Harnessing the Power of AWS IoT Rules with Substitution Templates](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog introduces how to leverage substitution templates in AWS IoT Rules to optimize IoT architecture. You will learn how AWS IoT Core and the rules engine use SQL-like syntax to filter, transform, and route data to over 20 AWS services. The article explains why substitution templates are the "secret weapon" that simplifies architecture, reduces Lambda dependencies, cuts costs, and increases scalability. The blog also illustrates 3 real-world scenarios: routing messages by partnerId from IoT Registry, intelligent load balancing across multiple Firehose streams using rand() + mod functions, and dynamic routing to different Lambda functions using CASE statements. Through these examples, you will see how to build flexible, serverless IoT solutions that are easier to maintain thanks to the ability to dynamically insert values directly in AWS IoT Rule actions.
