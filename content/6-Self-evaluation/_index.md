Throughout my internship at **[Amazon Web Service company]** from **[September 8, 2025]** to **[November 28, 2025]**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I acquired at school to a real-world work environment.
I participated in the **[First Cloud Journey program organized by AWS company]**, through which I learned many skills such as **[teamwork, acquiring new knowledge, and gaining the opportunity to experience a professional work environment]**.

Regarding work style, I always tried to complete tasks well, comply with regulations, and actively communicate with colleagues and mentors to improve work efficiency.
