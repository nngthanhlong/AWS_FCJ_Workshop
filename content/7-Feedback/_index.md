### General Assessment

**1. Work Environment**  
The atmosphere at FCJ is very comfortable and friendly. Everyone is approachable and always ready to help, even with questions after work hours when I face difficulties. The spacious, neat, and clean work space helps me concentrate better. The company frequently organizes interesting and beneficial events that help me learn new knowledge from those who came before.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor guided me very dedicatedly, explaining clearly every part I didn't understand and always encouraging me to ask questions freely. Especially at the beginning when I faced difficulties creating an AWS account, the team members helped me very enthusiastically, and during the final project, everyone supported my team tremendously.

**3. Alignment between Work and Academic Major**  
Although I studied Artificial Intelligence at school, when I interned at FCJ, I was exposed to the Cloud field — a field quite different from what I had previously learned. However, this actually helped me broaden my perspective and learn a lot of completely new knowledge that I hadn't had the opportunity to explore before. As a result, I not only supplemented practical skills but also gained a better understanding of how the systems behind the AI applications I studied in class actually work.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
During my internship, I learned many things: how to use project management tools, how to collaborate in a team, and how to communicate more professionally in a corporate environment. My mentor also shared many real-world experiences, helping me better understand what working in a corporate environment is like.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
I really like the culture here. Everyone respects each other, works seriously but maintains enjoyment. When teammates face account or project issues, everyone helps each other to the fullest, regardless of position or role. This made me feel that I'm not alone in the corporate environment.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company and school have created a good internship environment and flexible working hours when I have personal matters. Additionally, being able to participate in company-organized events helped me learn many valuable things — this is a big plus for me.


### Additional Questions

- **What are you most satisfied with during your internship?** -> What I'm most satisfied with during my internship is the spirit of FCJ team members. Everyone has such wonderful positive energy that made me feel comfortable even though it was our first meeting, making my internship experience very great. Especially those fruits that brother Kha bought for us every afternoon.

- **What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?**  -> After 3 months of internship based on my personal perception, the company has nothing that needs improvement for future interns.

- **If you recommend to your friends, would you recommend them to intern here? Why?** -> If I have friends, I will recommend everyone to intern here. Because I think beyond the excellent internship environment, knowledge is also a very important part, and this is knowledge that is quite necessary for people like us who study information technology, and I think everyone should try to get in touch with it to see if they're suited for this field, you never know if it might be the door that opens a path to a new horizon for everyone.
